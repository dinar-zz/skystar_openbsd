This is rough TODO list:
    o Clarify licence to be used: the code derived from linux driver to FreeBSD first, then ported to OpenBSD, what is the licence?
    o Add video/audio stream playback support, integrate with v4l port used in OpenBSD
    o clean up code, and make it easy to add new dvb hardware
